### Quick Install

The quick install quide will show how to install the "Experiments Portal" bundle, that comes with all available bundles, with an minimal effort. However, we would recommend to install the following bundles as well:
- Apache Felix File Install (org.apache.felix.fileinstall)
- Apache Felix Web Console (org.apache.felix.webconsole)

#### Step-by-Step Guide

-   Download [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org/downloads.cgi) 
-   Run Felix in your favorite bash
    ```sh
    java -jar bin\felix.jar 
    ```
- Install the following bundles:
    -   Metatype (org.apache.felix.metatype)
        ```sh
        obr:deploy org.apache.felix.metatype
        ```
    -   Jetty (org.apache.felix.http.jetty)
        ```sh
        obr:deploy  org.apache.felix.http.jetty
        ```
- Add the [recalot.com Repository](http://api.recalot.com/repo/repo.xml)
    ```sh
    obr:repos add http://api.recalot.com/repo/repo.xml
    ```
- Install "Recalot.com - Experiments Portal" (com.recalot.portal)
    ```sh
    obr:deploy com.recalot.portal
    ```
- Take a look at the bundles and start everything you need.
    -   List Bundles:
        ```sh
        lb
        ```
    -   Start Bundles:
        ```sh
        start {bundle-id}
        ```
